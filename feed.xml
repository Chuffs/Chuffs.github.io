&lt;p&gt;I have to admit it took a &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; long time to convert it to the more fluid and dynamic ways of Jekyll. As you can see the homepage is a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; different to what it was in “version one”. I have added a  few more parts to the page, such as sections for an about the site (about me page will be coming later, along with a contact form) as well as a truncated snapshot of the most recent blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do like how Jekyll operates and compiles the site, it gives you the option to have a much more versatile and modular webpage design - I just wish the documentation included more. It remind me very much of PHP in the way that you can have several different files combined into one page, for example - our homepage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page consists of 6 files, but Jekyll compiles it all into one when it ships the site. You use includes to add multiple html files into the one that you see on the site. These includes then allow me to use other sections of the this home page in other pages without having to rewrite all the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the homepage is now done, I might add a little more later - touch up on the styling or add a few more sections. To do next is other pages, such as the blog archive, portfolio archive and each post page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll update the blog once that is done, Peace for now,&lt;/p&gt;

I plan to update this blog once every week or so with what is going on with certain projects and with the website itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed this site is, so far, a one page wonder. There are links that don’t go anywhere, empty spaces, etc, etc. Over the next few months I plan to populate these pages and get a fully working website before the new year, I am also taking steps to make a mobile version of the website. Furthermore, I do plan on adding Jekyll to this site, which will allow me to better serve blot like posts and keep the site up to date - I’ll let you know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for content on this web-based portfolio, expect to see tech content, varying from tech reviews to in depth tech related projects - such as computer/server builds and electronic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan to start the majority of my larger projects I have planned until the new year and 2018, but I will update this site over the next coming months, some projects that I definitely want to start include a DIY keyboard, a MicroChip PIC18 development board and various home servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a bit about me - I am a 20 year old tech enthusiast currently studying The Bachelor of Engineering (Computer and Network Science). I have a strong love for all sorts of tech including PC components, programming and electronic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up to date with MicroMatt, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chuffs97&quot; title=&quot;My Twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsjYwlaeT48XV7kxRLkE6bw&quot; title=&quot;My YouTube Channel&quot;&gt;YouTube account&lt;/a&gt; - I do plan to add some form of newsletter at a later stage too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading the first entry of the blog, I hope to post more and be as active as I can be. Peace for now,&lt;/p&gt;
